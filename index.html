    <h1>My painting experience.</h1>
    <p>
      I had the understanding that career is not job. Some of us make the
      mistake of a life time by thinking and living with choices that
      prioritized job over career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do whatever job you can, lawful and godly, to build your career. There is
      no excuse. Go out there, and do something, at the long run you will be
      proud you did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not be too ashamed or too proud to do what you must, lawful and godly,
      to achieve your dreams. Do not run your life with another man's time.
    </p>
    <h2>Subtle lessons learnt</h2>
    <p>
      Do not be too ashamed or too proud to do what you must, lawful and godly,
      to achieve your dreams. Do not run your life with another man's time.
      There's not enough money for me to pursue what I want, but I'm not limited
      to do what I don't want in order to get what I want. We are afflicted but
      not constrained. Do not allow yourself to be pressured into ungodliness in
      any form. There is always a way out.
    </p>
    <p>No matter how short you are, if you go out you will see the sky ☺️.</p>
    <p>
      Our parents and relatives may be limited to assist you, but with time and
      energy on your side you will succeed if you put them to good use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not be too ashamed or too proud to beg. It is better they tell you they
      don't have than for you to assume they don't. It is better they refuse
      than for you not to try out of fear that they would refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But never you ever feel entitled to anything from anyone. This mentality
      is killing us as a people. Even when you are, don't feel so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not worry about anything at all. So long as you're willing and obedient
      you shall eat the fruit of the earth.
    </p>
    <h3>La familia</h3>
    <p>
      No matter what happens, remember your family. It comes before anything
      after God. It should be;
    </p>
    <p>God Family(nuclear and extended) State(for the Patriots) Others.</p>
    <p>
      If your family backs you up with positive vibes and acknowledgement, ijebe
      go. (We'll explore my experience on this on another occasion).
    </p>
    <h4>Eternal gratitude</h4>
    <p>
      I'm eternally grateful to God who has used my ugly experiences to shape my
      mind. I'm happy with what I have because of what I know. I have no regrets
      over past events for I know a God who is a master in using our past
      mistakes and error to achieve the best if we but allow him.
